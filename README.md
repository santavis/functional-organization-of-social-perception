"Functional organization of social perception in the human brain" 
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2023.120025

Consensus clustering anlaysis was performed to limit the social perceptual space
into a limited number of social dimensions

Low-level audiovisual featuess of the stimulus film clips were extracted with custom scripts.
The fMRI analyses of social perception were controlled with these low-level features.

Leave-one-out-optimised ridge regression was used for linear modelling of fMRI responses to social dimensions.

Multivariate classification analysis was used to decode social dimensions 
from fMRI brain activations patterns in a between subject classification approach.

Detailed description of the workflow can be found in the article.
